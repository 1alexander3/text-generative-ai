# text-generative-ai
A neural network machine learning model that predicts the next word of a given text sequence. The model will also generate text based on its training.

Future Improvements: 
Improve accuracy with predicitive modeling, the model is limited by its training
The model can be used as a basis for an interactive ai
Create new versions of the ai for specific use cases: geography, guessing games, math, etc...
